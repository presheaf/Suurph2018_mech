Benchmark 1:
Works ok with neoHookean material, diverges with Guccione.
- Can this be fixed with different nonlinear solver settings?
- If not, should we try a fully incompressible (mixed) formulation?

Benchmark 2:
1. We need to mark two parts of the boundary:
- The base should have homogeneuos Dirichlet conditions. The endocardium should have a time-varying pressure
- Are these boundary parts marked as subdomains in the files benchmark.h5 or simple_ellipsoid.h5?

2. Need to change the material type to Guccione, using either Henrik's material class or something simpler

3. Need to extract the microstructure from the hf files (see pulse demos)


Benchmark 3:
- Add simple contraction to benchmark 2
